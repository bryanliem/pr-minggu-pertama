two ways of managing a hacking project
- The cathedral
1. top down controlled approach
2. everything handled in house with a few developers
3. releasing a finished product only when kinks are worked out 
    only released occasionally

-The bazaar
1. open and wide ranging
2. multiple releases handled in quick succession 
    used for feedback from users and other hackers
3. tasks delegated to others
    everyobone contributes to the final porduct

- great deal of work still handled by you
1. organizing the project
2. making decisions about the software
3. incorporating pieces worked on by others 

good ideas from your users can be a great contribution
1. make sure to implement good ideas in future releases
2. release early, release often 
    mark them as development releases

project development 
- necessity is the mother of invention
1. ideas usually come from a need the hacker has
2. if you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you

-good coders know how to reuse
1. look around for a previous effort and start from there
